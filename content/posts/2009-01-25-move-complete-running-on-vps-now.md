Completed my move to [ServerFreak&#8217;s VPS][1] this morning.

Still ironing out a few bugs with my mail,DNS and hardening. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have them fixed by the end of the holidays.

From my observation so far, I think the site&#8217;s a bit faster now. But, that could just be my mind playing tricks on me. You tell me, has the speed improved?
