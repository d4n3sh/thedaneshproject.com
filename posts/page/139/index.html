A Malaysians’ answer!</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>Before I begin, this is my first official post in my bro’s blog. Just for the record, I am Azlina Manoharan and my bro is Danesh Manoharan. I guess you see the MUHIBAH-ness of my family mirrored through our names!
Okay, back to my view.
I share the same view as you Abi! We can already see that everyone who was not in support of this rally blaming HINDRAF and their supporters for causing chaos on a calm and peaceful country.
We are accused of being racial! Come on. Grow up! Find some other reasons to look down on us. We are not fighting for Indian rites you fools. Its about the rights of Malaysians. It is not only Indians that are suffering in this country. Everyone who has got no contacts or strings to pull in the government are basically citizens who are non-existent in the this country.
Yes, there are things done to benefit the poor but in the process of giving to the poor, 3/4 of the funds are lost midway, and we know where it all goes. Everyone knows this as a fact but no one wants to question this. Why? Because those who are in the position to ask and be heard don’t want to loose their income and position in society. On the other hand, those who are willing to ask don’t have anyone who is willing to take them seriously. How then are we to ask for our rights. A simple example, we asked for a permit to just hand in this Petition, but no, we were refused. I wonder what would have happened if Azalina would have wanted to organize a rally in a similar nature to make a request to the British Govt to allow the development of the sports complex for the training of our athletes. That would have been allowed rite? No chaos would have been caused isn’t it?

My Dad and sis were at the Hindraf(Hindu Rights Action Force) gathering this morning to support the Petition being submitted to the British High Commission. This is her story.
Today was a proud day to be an Indian in Malaysia! We have awakened from a long sleep! Wanna know why? Let me tell you my story, as one individual that formed one of the hundred thousands that were gathered around the British embassy in several areas despite the tear gas, water canons containing chemicals and police road blocks. My dad and me decided to take the LRT to Ampang Park LRT Station which is the closest to the embassy. Reason being many of the main roads were closed. However, we met our first obstacle. The train did not stop at the KLCC station and neither did it stop at the Ampang Park station. A true Malaysian, a Muslim, told us that both stations were closed and that the train will only stop at Kg. Baru, a station before the KLCC station and Damai station, a station after Ampang Park. He even told us the way to get to the gathering and this is without we requesting any information from him. This is a person who understood the reason for the gathering. It was not a gathering purely for the rights of Indians but Malaysians as a whole. So, we got down at the Damai station and started walking towards KLCC. A large group of people were following at the back of us. Very proud to have such support, we started walking even faster. Suddenly, we saw a group of people walking from the opposite direction. One young man stopped to inform us that tear gas is being shot by the police. He asked us to turn back because the effects of the tear gas was so bad that we would not be able to take it. We told him thank you for the information and that we have come so far, we are not going to turn back just because tear gas is being shot. We continued to walk towards KLCC. The large group behind us was also marching with us. We finally reached the Jalan Semarak junction. ...</p></section><footer class=entry-footer>November 25, 2007&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Danesh</footer><a class=entry-link aria-label="post link to Hindraf, proud day for Malaysian Indians" href=https://d4n3sh.github.io/thedaneshproject.com/posts/hindraf-proud-day-for-malaysian-indians/></a></article><article class=post-entry><header class=entry-header><h2>Downloading gOS</h2></header><section class=entry-content><p>We all want it but no it’s not Google OS.
